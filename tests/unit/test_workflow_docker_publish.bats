# Guards for the sandbox-image publishing workflow (Issue #298)
#
# docker-publish.yml builds the default ralph-sandbox image on release tags
# (v*), smoke-tests it, and pushes to GHCR. These grep-based guards pin the
# load-bearing properties; SHA pinning and checkout credential hygiene are
# enforced by the generic guards (test_workflow_sha_pinning.bats,
# test_workflow_credential_hygiene.bats — both list this workflow).
