# E2E tests for complete Ralph loop execution (Issue #17)
#
# These tests run ralph_loop.sh as a TRUE SUBPROCESS with a mock `claude`
# executable on disk — exercising the full lifecycle: startup validation,
# loop iterations, response analysis, exit detection, and final status.
# See tests/e2e/helpers/e2e_helper.bash for the harness.
#
# Scenarios already covered at unit/integration level (sourced functions) are
# intentionally NOT duplicated here; each test below verifies behavior that
# only manifests in a real end-to-end subprocess run.
